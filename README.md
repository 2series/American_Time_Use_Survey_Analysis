American Time Use Survey Analysis

The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) is a time-use survey of Americans, which is sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Respondents of the survey are asked to keep a diary for one day carefully recording the amount of time they spend on various activities including working, leisure, childcare, and household activities. The survey has been conducted every year since 2003.

Included in the data are main demographic variables such as respondents' age, sex, race, marital status, and education. The data also includes detailed income and employment information for each respondent. While there are some slight changes to the survey each year, the main questions asked stay the same. You can find the data dictionaries for each year on [https://www.bls.gov/tus/dictionaries.htm](https://www.bls.gov/tus/dictionaries.htm)
